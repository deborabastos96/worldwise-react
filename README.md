# WorldWise

WorldWise is a single-page application where users can register all the cities they have ever traveled to, adding notes if they want. There is a list with all visited cities and countries.

Clicking on a city will move the map there and display all the details about the city name, date, notes, and a link to the Wikipedia article.

This site was created using React + Vite, React Router, CSS Modules, Context API, and Leaflet.
